It's Easter Sunday so for a lot of people that means one thing: chocolate! This morning, the kids on my street were out in numbers to hunt the eggs that the easter bunny left in all the gardens.

## From the archives

From the very recent archives, a subject that comes up time and again with people who are new to screen reader testing: the tab key. Three things:

- The majority of screen reader users are blind

## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs from around the web that I read during March:

- [An HTML Switch Control](https://webkit.org/blog/15054/an-html-switch-control/)

- [Web accessibility survey](https://webaccessibilitysurvey.com/survey-results/)
- [On popover accessibility: what the browser does and doesn’t do](https://hidde.blog/popover-accessibility/)

Anyway, I'm off to find out how much chocolate I can eat before I throw up; catch you again this time next month! 🍫🍫🍫
