title: üê∏ Leap year day!
---

A slightly-longer-than-usual shortest-month-of-the-year has also proved to be my busiest month in a while‚Ä¶ No articles for you this time round, but I did do some newsletter-related work on my website: a brand new [an archive of all my newsletters](https://www.tempertemper.net/newsletter/archive) so you can catch up on the ones from before you joined the club!


## From the archives

This one has featured in ‚ÄòFrom the archives‚Äô before, but I was thinking about it again now that version 2.2 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) [deprecated 4.1.1 Parsing](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#parsing).

Validating your markup and following the HTML and ARIA specifications is still a very good idea, even if it‚Äôs no longer a WCAG requirement*. Here‚Äôs my article from October 2021: [If HTML and ARIA don‚Äôt allow it, it‚Äôs probably a bad idea](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/if-html-and-aria-dont-allow-it-its-probably-a-bad-idea).

*It still is if you‚Äôre looking to comply with WCAG 2.1.

## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs from around the web that I read (and watched!) during February:

- [WebAIM Screen Reader User Survey #10 Results](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey10/)
- A quiz: [Does it fail 1.4.5 Images of Text?](https://www.tpgi.com/does-it-fail-1-4-5-images-of-text/)
- [Use Positive Language](https://www.ta11y.org/learning/topic?key=writing.lang_positive)
- [The problem with placeholders and what to do instead](https://adamsilver.io/blog/the-problem-with-placeholders-and-what-to-do-instead/)
- [axe-con 2024](https://www.deque.com/axe-con/) has just happened and you can access all the recordings by registering now

Anyway, I‚Äôm going to get writing some blog posts for next month‚Äôs newsletter; I‚Äôll see you again at the end of March ‚úçÔ∏è
