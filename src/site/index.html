intro: |
    Before you go any further, a quick disclaimer: this website has not style today! To find why, read about [CSS Naked Day](/blog/css-naked-day).

    Iâ€™m Martin, a user interface and interaction designer, lover of HTML and CSS, and co-founder of [Frontend NE](https://2019.frontendne.co.uk). I'm a Principal Experience Designer at [Sage](https://www.sage.com/), where I work as an accessibility specialist. Here's a wee bit more [about me](/about) and [what I'm up to now](/now).
