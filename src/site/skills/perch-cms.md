I've been building websites using Perch since 2010. It has an easy to interpret structure, which makes working with it a joy, but more importantly the intuitive design of the control panel makes it extremely easy for my clients to update their content.

Not only is its interface easy to use, it's focused on structured content, which means it can be put together so that website owners find it difficult to break the website's design, and content regions can be reused easily.

Another huge plus is that it is completely unopinionated as to the markup used. It doesn't add its own and doesn't require extra HTML in its templates. What you write is exactly whatâ€™s output to the page.
