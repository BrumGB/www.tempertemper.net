Call it user experience design, UX design, usability design

Like [frontend development](/skills/frontend-development), 'user experience' is too broad to talk about without breaking it down further.

Interaction design is my user experience specialism. The designs I produce are carefully thought through, inclusive, accessible, user-centred and always tested with real users. Some tools and deliverables I enjoy producing:

- User journey diagrams, user flows and sitemaps
- Wireframes
- More detailed mock-ups and basic prototypes in software like Sketch and Figma
- Code-based prototypes (built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript)

User research is often counted as part of user experience design, and I've done my fair share, but I prefer to work with the information gleaned *by a user researcher* (as well as customer satisfaction scores, analytics and other performance metrics) to inform, iterate and validate my designs.

I am a capable content designer and enjoy thinking deeply about how the language used in an interface, and across a whole product or service affects the user's experience.

Service design has been a big part of what I do as a designer, considering more end-to-end user journeys, from sign-up processes and documentation/guidance to email notifications and fixing pain points with the human beings that sit behind a product or service.
