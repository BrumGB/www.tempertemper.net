title: User interface design
intro: |
    How an interface looks/feels is important; not only should it be on-brand, but the components it comprises should be consistent and documented.

The interfaces I design tend towards the minimal. This not only allows space to 'breathe', but it reduces clutter, ensuring only content that is *needed* is on the page.

Consistency of components is important as it provides visual cohesion across a website (whether a marketing/brochure website, e-commerce platform, or web application), as well as code reuse and efficiency.

Using a pattern library is vital when delivering a website design, at whatever stage of maturity, as they provide:

- central point of reference for designs
- go-to for code
- place to document rationale and research
