A design system is vital to the long term health of a digital product.


I initially created a library in [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), which was great for the initial concepts and even creating prototypes, but it soon became apparent that a [code-based pattern library](https://fractal.build/) would provide the flexibility I needed.

Sketch would always come in useful though – for new components or page arrangements, it's usually simplest to use a drawing tool like Sketch.
