    YSo you'd like me to work with you on your project? That's great! Thanks for thinking of me and for taking the time to get in touch. Before we go any further, have a quick read of this page.

Terms and conditions are often tedious and money can be a bit of an awkward thing to talk about. Before we go any further, in an attempt to not waste anyone's time, it's a good idea to let you know how I work.

I love what I do and take pride in having invested time, money and a great deal of energy into developing my skills as a user experience designer, frontend developer and accessibility specialist. I'm constantly reading up on the latest developments in the web industry, brushing up my skills and challenging myself wherever possible.

It's often reassuring to know that you're working with a professional, but after many years as a freelance/contractor, I am now employed full-time. This means any projects I take on have to be flexible enough to accommodate my evenings-and-weekends availability.


## My approach

I work in a very consultative manner in order to deliver your content to your users in the most effective way possible. I care about the final product and this means I often question or challenge ideas clients bring to me (very politely and diplomatically, of course; I'm far from the argumentative type!). Having said that, please don't be shy with *your* ideas: you know your business better than anyone!

### Website projects

The web is for everyone and, while the really technical stuff is best left to geeks like me, you'll come away from the project with a good understanding of how the web works. This is useful as you're be responsible for the ongoing maintenance of your site's content.

Your website is an ongoing work in progress. Once the project has finished we'll arrange a call 6 months down the line to go through your [analytics](/blog/google-analytics) and discuss any feedback you might have received from visitors. I believe long lasting relationships between website owners and web designers produce the most effective websites.

Finally, if it's not the right time to start your website I'll tell you. I'll even give you guidance on how to prepare things properly. Your money, wherever possible, should remain in your pocket – no sense in spending money on work that will later be undone.

### Consultation


## Cost

My fee depends on the type of work you'd like me to do and length of contract. When outlining what your project is, please give a clear expectation of **what** you would like me to do, **when** you'd like it to be done by, and the **budget** you have available.

To give you a very rough idea of my prices:

- Start to finish website projects can usually be costed as a project, which usually comes in at between £6,000+VAT to £12,000+VAT
- For consultation/freelance projects, my day rate starts at £550+VAT

### Ongoing maintenance

Many projects, especially website design and build, require some ongoing maintenance. This covers things like:

- Keeping the codebase current, removing or refining older code that may be deprecated
- Keeping up with browser advances
- Keeping up to date with the latest search engine requirements

### Expenses

I'll sometimes have some expenses for your project, such as travel costs, hotel costs (if early starts or late nights are needed), subsistence costs if away from home, and any project-specific equipment or software.

These expenses can either be included in your estimate so you’ll know in advance, or taken care of in my day rate, if keeping things simple is better for you.

Licensing costs that you may incur, for example [web-fonts](/blog/webfonts) and stock image licenses, will be paid by you directly.

If anything unexpected crops up during the project I’ll let you know as far in advance as possible so that you can approve it.

### Negotiations

I'm yet to come across a project with unlimited funds, so I'm well accustomed to working within the constraints of a set budget.

If your budget won't stretch to the total estimated project price, I'm happy to work with you to reduce the scope in a way that will allow us to work together.

A limited initial budget may mean a reduced initial amount of work followed by a series of regular monthly 'retainer' payments, allowing you to spread the cost (and the work) over a longer period.

It's not unheard of that a client comes to me wanting `A`, `B` and `C` and it turns out that `C` isn't necessary or will detract from `A` and `B`, somehow. If I see that this is the case, I'll let you know and we can reduce the scope of the project to just `A` and `B`. Having assumed `C` was going to be part of the project, you may have budget remaining that you'd still like to invest, in which case I can help advise you to maximise the return on revenue spent.

### Discounts and volunteering

If I were to work at a discounted rate I'd be unable to dedicate as much time to working on paid projects and my own professional development.

That doesn't mean I'd never discount or waive my fee if the project is something I feel strongly about and is a genuinely unique opportunity, so if you are unable to pay a reasonable fee, but you have valid and compelling reasons why, then please let me know. I *may* choose to involve myself with the project if I'm able to without it interfering with my paid work, but please don't come to me *expecting* I will work for no pay. And please don't be offended if I turn down an opportunity to work with you because you don't have the budget to pay me.

### Grants

I may take a wee bit of persuading to accept commissions that are wholly or partially funded by grants. I've found that clients who aren't spending their own hard-earned cash are often less invested in their project, which can have negative a knock-on effect on my other clients.

### Working speculatively

I believe that speculative work (where a designer is asked to work as part of a 'competition', where only the 'winner' is compensated for their work) can have a place for aspiring designers/developers, but as an experienced professional I work *with* others, not in competition with them, and require a deposit to be paid before I can begin any work.


## Contract

I draw up a contract for every job I undertake. My contracts are in plain English (as little [legalese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_writing#Legalese) as I can get away with!) and ensure there will be no misunderstandings. They cover, among other things, what materials you'll give me so that I can do the job for you, a breakdown of the job itself, payment terms and details of copyright ownership.

The first contract I send you isn't necessarily the one we'll both sign. It's for you to read through carefully and make sure you're happy with everything. I'm happy to consider any amendments, so if you'd like to see any changes just ask and I'll see what I can do.

Once we have agreed a document and you've signed it and sent it back, we're nearly ready to book a block of time in my diary! Just one more thing…


## Deposit

As I've already mentioned, I require a deposit for every piece of work I undertake, large or small. This is typically 50% of the estimated project cost or a week's time in advance (depending on how we've agreed to work).

Once the deposit has cleared in my account and the contract has been signed, we're ready to go!

### Consultation days

Sometimes the requirements and scope of a project are not known. If this is the case, I can work with you to produce them. My time for this is billable by the day, must be paid for up front, and is separate to any potential future project costs.


## What next?

So I hope there were no surprises there and everything was what you were expecting. If it all sounds good and, in principle, you're looking forward to us working together, [get in touch](/contact) and we can talk about your project!
