    <p>If you prefer to dive straight in rather than <a href="/blog/">see the full blog</a>, here are a couple of my favourite articles from the last few months to get you started.</p>

    <h2 id="my-favourite-subjects">Subjects</h2>
    <p>There are a few topics that really interest me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/category/accessibility">Accessibility</a> is about designing and building web interfaces that can be used by anyone, something I feel very strongly about.</li>
        <li><a href="/category/design">Designing</a> smart, usable interfaces, journeys and interactions is what I do best, and I enjoy analysing othersâ€™ great design.</li>
        <li><a href="/category/development">Frontend development</a> is a huge passion of mine; HTML and CSS in particular, but anything from Git to Gulp.</li>
    </ul>
     <p>Or have a look at the <a href="/categories">full list of subjects</a> I write about.</p>
