intro: |
    It's important to know what makes people tick, and what makes them comfortable. This [user manual](https://betterprogramming.pub/personal-user-manuals-the-good-the-bad-and-the-template-7b80db5044ea) should give you an insight into how I work best.

## Conditions I like to work in

- I'm quite territorial, so in a shared office environment I like having my own desk
- I like my work environment to be clutter-free and clean
- A bit of noise is fine, but interruptions should be kept to a minimum
- I am not interested in rank/grade unless to offer support, if I'm talking to with someone less grizzled than myself


## The times/hours I like to work

- I like to work a rough 8:30am to 4:30pm day, Monday to Friday
- Sometimes I'll take a longer lunch and catch up in the evening
- Evenings and weekends are family time so all work communication channels are closed; by all means contact me, but I won't see your message until the next working day


## The best ways to communicate with me

- Slack is the best place to get hold of me for a chat through something as I prefer a (asynchronous if need be) written exchange where possible
- Sometimes an audio or video call is the best way to do things, and these should be arranged via written message first
- Don't text or call me on my personal number unless it's a personal issue or an emergency
- I check my emails a couple of times a day at most and aim to respond within a few of days, so don't email with anything that needs an urgent response


## The ways I like to receive feedback

- Public praise (directed at me) makes me uncomfortable
- Feedback is sometimes awkward but should always be done face to face; if it is honest and direct, it will be received gratefully
- Don't worry about offending me: I'm pretty thick skinned, and besides, learning is what life is about and feedback accelerates growth


## Things I need

- Sustained, uninterrupted concentration time
- After years of self reliance and risk-management as a small business owner, I need a real feeling of security from my employer, since employment means all my eggs are in one basket
- A wee nudge is welcome if you're in a rush for something and I haven't responded as quickly as you'd've liked


## Things I struggle with

- Mixed messages â€“ say what you mean!
- Bluster; if you're full of shit, I'll know
- I'm an introvert, so, while I *really* enjoy a good chat, extended periods of one to one or group interaction leave me drained
- Saying 'no'; I'm an [agreeable giver](https://qz.com/work/1309735/adam-grant-the-best-employees-are-not-the-agreeable-ones/) but I know when to push back, even though it's not easy for me
- Lots of meetings
- Unnecessary meetings
- `@channel` and `@here` on Slack, which should be used mindfully
- Attending out of work activities: two small children and no family nearby to ease the load makes these tricky


## Things I love

- Spending time mentoring more junior designers
- In-depth conversations about design details
- Sharing my knowledge and experience of accessibility
- Learning


## Other things to know about me

- After doing what I do for so long I have a strong intuition for the right design
- Sometimes, when on the spot, my [Spidey-sense](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Spidey-sense) will tingle, but I won't have an answer as to why something is an issue until I've gone away and had some alone time to think it through
- When presenting, I don't work well with pre-prepared notes, instead I prefer to have a framework to follow and ad-lib around each point
- Everything I do is done with the best intentions; if you ever think otherwise, let's have a chat, as it's almost certainly a misunderstanding or some missing context
- I have a real knack of seeing both sides of a problem
- I am very open to being proved wrong
- I'm happy to ask the 'stupid' question on behalf of my colleagues who might not be as comfortable putting themselves in the firing line
- I'm an [INFP-A](https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality) personality type
- I love an [interesting fact](https://twitter.com/qikipedia)!
