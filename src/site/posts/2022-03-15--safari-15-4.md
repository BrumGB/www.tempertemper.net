macOS 12.3 and iOS 15.4 landed yesterday, and with them came Safari 15.4 which [brings some exciting new features](https://webkit.org/blog/12445/new-webkit-features-in-safari-15-4/). Here are the five that stood out to me:

- CSS's [`:focus-visible` pseudo-class](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/safari-focus-visible-and-accessibility), which is now finally supported across all modern browsers
- The `loading="lazy"` HTML attribute for images, which only loads images when they're in or just-about-to-be-in the viewport
- The native `<dialog>` element and its partner `::backdrop` pseudo-element
- The `:has()` pseudo-class, which essentially gives us a way to select a parent element in CSS! Let's hope more browsers follow soon
- The `accent-color` property, which allows us to style the default colours of form elements
