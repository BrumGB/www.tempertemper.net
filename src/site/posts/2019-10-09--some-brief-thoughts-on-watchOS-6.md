A quick summary of my thoughts on the newest operating system for Apple Watch:

- I *love* the new <b>Meridian watch face</b> -- turn off all the complications and this is the perfect watch face (Series 4 and 5 only); classy and fills the whole screen, rounded-corner to rounded-corner
- The <b>Calculator app</b> is nicely implemented but might be fiddly on the older 38mm watches; weird it has taken until now to add something so basic
- <b>'Find People' is now built in</b> -- My wife and I share locations, so now I can ask Siri where she is without taking my phone out of my pocket or bag
- <b>Siri is better</b> -- it used to be pretty useless other than for sending a message or making a phone call, but now it works more or less like it does on the phone itself
- <b>List View for apps</b> looks great -- subtly curved as you scroll through; surely this should be the default instead of the awful (and impractical) honeycomb Grid View
- I thought the <b>Rain complication</b> would be more usefulâ€¦ I'd like to know at a glance how if it'll be dry enough over the course of the day to ride my longboard to work (I'm really not a fan of the bus), but it only gives the current percentage chance of rain, which is what windows are for
- I love the new <b>Reminders app</b> and it's now a bit easier to use on the watch than it used to be
- <b>Awards</b> now appear as a third swipe-across option in the Workouts app, after Sharing, where they used to only be available on the phone
- The <b>App Store</b> is another step toward de-coupling from the iPhone, but I'm not sure it *needs to* like the iPhone needed to decouple from iTunes on a laptop
