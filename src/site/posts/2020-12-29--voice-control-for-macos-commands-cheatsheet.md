title: Voice Control for macOS commands cheatsheet
intro: |
    I have a list of all the commands for Voice Control for macOS, and it comes in handy pretty much every time I do any speech recognition testing.

Although I've done a fair bit of testing using Voice Control on macOS over the past year or so, I'm far from an every day user, so something that comes in very handy is my cheatsheet.

This is basically copy of the commands in Preferences → Accessibility → Voice Control → Commands…, but has the advantage of being text/HTML, so it's searchable. So if you ever need to remind yourself of any Voice Control commands, feel free to `⌘` + `f` your way through this page!
