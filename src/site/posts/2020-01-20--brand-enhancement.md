title: Brand enhancement
intro: |
    My original brand served me well for my first few years of business, but in 2014 it got the overhaul it needed. And it was almost perfect…

My original brand was ok. I used the friendly-looking [Museo Sans](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo-sans/) as my main typeface and my logo used [OCR-A](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/ocra/), a retro monospace font, set white on a smokey blue background with the words 'temper' and 'temper' stacked on top of one another.

It served me well for the first few years, but it was always something I was looking to overhaul. I set five rules:

1. I had always _written_ 'tempertemper' as one word, so the logo should follow this – no separation
2. The logo should include some kind of icon or motif that I could use separately
3. It should work well against a white background, which my original logo never really did
4. It should convert well to work against a dark/black background, which my original logo definitely never did
5. Without losing friendliness, the typefaces should feel more classic; less cartoony

My re-brand work started with the logo, with the notion that the typeface and general colour palette would stem from there.

I've always been a fan of [Helvetica Neue](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/) in a bold weight, so a lot of early concepts involved that. But the way the `r` of the first `temper` met the `t` of the second didn't sit right (the ear of the `r` is thicker than the crossbar of the `t`), and adjusting the space between those letters only felt like they were becoming separate words again. Also, Helvetica Neue's lowercase `a` and uppercase `R` are *incredibly* elegant, so a logo without them felt like a missed opportunity.

It was progress, but it only fully satisfied one rule:

1. It was presented as one word
2. There was no motif/icon
3. As the bold letterforms were more distinct, it worked better than the original logo against a white background, but it wasn't great
4. Similarly, it worked *ok* on a black background
4. Although beautiful, Helvetica Neue can feel a bit aloof

So in the summer of 2014 I called in my good friend Ant Barker, who I've collaborated with on countless client projects. He built upon the work I'd been doing and came up with something we were both very happy with!

1. It was presented as one word
2. An underscore, which represents a cursor, tying it into both coding and writing
3. The black text works well against a white background and the (newly brightened) blue in the underscore provided a touch of vibrancy/fun
4. It was easily switched to white text to accommodate a dark background
4. The typeface (FS-Me) draws inspiration from Helvetica, so feels classic, but has a much more approachable feel:
    - There are no sharp edges to the letterforms
    - The softened corners on that previously-troublesome first `r` and second `t` mean they flow into one another well, despite having different thicknesses
    - The upward curves of the terminals on the `t` give it a wee bit of extra energy
    - The `e`s are especially friendly-looking
    What's more, [FS-Me was designed with accessibility in mind](/blog/tempertempers-typefaces) which very much appeals to me


## An iteration

In the five and a half years since that branding work my business has changed a lot! And the branding was flexible enough to allow for that, but one thing has been bugging me all those years: there wasn't a true icon.

The square canvas version of the logo used the two `t`s and the underscore, which looked smart enough, but:

- It drew attention to the `t`s as initial letters of two separate words; something I'd be looking to avoid
- Letter-based icons feel too easy! I wanted a single shape/mark
- It's not all that distinguishable at very small sizes
- Some people [think of cars](https://www.audi.co.uk/models/tt/tt-coupe.html) when they see two `t`s

### A new icon

I've been tinkering with the idea of a new, more illustrative, stand-alone icon since late 2015. I have countless pages of ideas, with icons sitting alongside the `tempertemper` logotype.

I started with blue fire icon, which was a (tenuous) [reference to tempering steel](/blog/why-tempertemper), where metal is heated up then rapidly cooled down in order to increase its durability and efficiency. The fire icon went through revision after revision as I *wanted* to like it, but it wasn't right.

The more icons I tried—a rocket ship (too cutesy), a star (too bold), a lightening bolt (too aggressive), a broadcast symbol (too RSS)—the more I felt simpler was the way to go – some kind of punctuation; an ASCII character.

An asterisk looked nice but suggested there might be some small print. Curly braces `{}` had the right tone but have been done to death. Square brackets? A caret? A triangle? Square? Circle? An arrow? Nah.

Then I saw a blog post by [Amy Hupe](https://amyhupe.co.uk) in my Twitter timeline that used a great big square full-stop as its icon, and it hit me: *the underscore was right all along*! All it needed was some tweaking and it could be used as a stand-alone icon in its own right.

Don't see much difference? Well, there's not! But if you look closely:

- The underscore is <b>thicker</b>, to match the widths of ascenders (vertical lines) in the letters of the logotype, making it more prominent at smaller sizes
- It now has <b>square corners</b>, making it a perfect rectangle and well and truly checking the 'simplicity' box
- I gave it a <b>simple 4 × 1 aspect ratio</b>, which felt like the right proportions; it also fits nicely into an 8x8 square canvas

As I had been doing with all of my ideas, I ran it past Ant for a zoomed out perspective:

> Its a subtle improvement to something that I always thought looked great. So it’s a yes from me!

So it turned out, as with most things design, the simplest solution was the best.
