A couple of years ago, one of my colleagues introduced the idea of a personal user manual to the design team. It didn't really take hold as a 'thing', but I quite liked the idea.

I think it came from [Cassie Robinson's post](https://cassierobinson.medium.com/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694), where you can also find some templates to go from.

The aim is to give your colleagues an easy to scan overview of what makes you tick:

- The conditions you like to work in
- The hours you prefer
- The best ways to communicate with you
- The ways to give you feedback
- Things that you need
- Things you struggle with
- Things you love
- Other interesting stuff

The key is, at least for me, that it's all about soft skills. Or soft *stuff*, as it's not always about *skills*, per se.

If nothing else, it's a nice bit of self-analysis, which is something I should probably do more often.

Anyway, [here's my user manual](/user-manual). I hope it gives you a bit of an insight into how I like to work, and maybe it'll prompt a bit of an activity within your team so you can understand each other even better.
