A big reason a lot of people update their operating system is [new emojis](https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1306413329544605698); iOS 15.4 Beta has recently been released and, for the first time in a while, [there's a clutch of new emojis](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1487307750602420224). I'll be updating as soon as it's released, but not (solely!) because of the emojis.

I had a scan through [Macworld's roundup of features coming in iOS 15.4](https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/ios-154-when-features-3812866/), and the stand-out feature for me was iCloud Keychain Notes.

MacRumours goes into [more detail on the feature](https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/add-notes-icloud-keychain-entries-ios/), explaining how an 'Add Notes' button will be available in Passwords, Apple's new password manager (Settings → Passwords), that makes a textarea available to type whatever you want; things like:

- Memorable words
- Two factor authentication backup keys
- PIN numbers (yes, I know the 'N' stands for 'Number'…)
- Email address, if it's not also the Username
- Extra information like server addresses and port numbers

I'm a long time [1Password](https://1password.com/) user and have always bought the newest version of app whenever it was upgraded. A shut-up-and-take-my-money situation. But things have started to change in recent years.


## The problems with 1Password

Five years or so ago 1Password launched memberships, where for a monthly subscription they would host the encrypted password vaults. I had always used Dropbox to sync, so, although I participated in the Beta for memberships, it wasn't really something that I needed, so I went back to using the service the way I always had.

In recent years 1Password have been making a strong push towards the subscription model. This makes sense for business users, but for individuals…? The £2.99 per month they currently charge for a license is not a lot of money but add that to Netflix, Disney+, and the rest of the things the average household pays for each month and it feels like a stretch.

This subscription push is only set to continue, now that they've [raised a further $620 million](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/01/19/1password-funding) and investors want to see a return.

Another symptom of the need to make their investors money is the decision to [abandon native technology for their Mac app](https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/08/not-important-enough-1password-abandons-its-native-mac-app/); understandable from a dollars-and-cents business perspective, but being a great *native* Mac app is part of what made the product successful in the first place. Yet another web-wrapper that doesn't feel quite at home on the Mac and has [funky keyboard shortcuts](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1488446366200311812?s=20&t=wLmtte1-vaYX9lnkTNGXPA) isn't something I can get excited about.

Something else I've noticed is that 1Password's new [iOS browser extension doesn't work without a membership](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1443091157681123331). So people like me who bought the app and sync vaults with other services are starting to be left out of features.

1Password, like Dropbox, feels [more like a feature than a product](https://www.businessinsider.com/drew-houston-dropbox-steve-jobs-2017-6?r=US&IR=T), and Apple are building that feature across their ecosystem just like they did with iCloud Drive. It's true that 1Password offers a lot more power and flexibility than as Apple's password management system, which:

- doesn't offer structured data for things like passports, email accounts, and so on
- doesn't have tags (though I don't make heavy use of these)
- only works in Safari
- hasn't got shared vaults

But, all things told, I'm ready to make those compromises.

In fact, removing 1Password from my workflow will mean [I no longer need Dropbox](/blog/stop-the-ride-i-want-to-get-off), which will feel good uninstall.

With iOS 15.4 and iCloud Keychain Notes, Apple's Passwords will finally have enough for me to cut the cord with 1Password, and spend the time [migrating my 1023 passwords across](https://simonbs.dev/posts/moving-from-1password-to-icloud-keychain/). I'll miss 1Password, a faithful companion over the last decade or more, but things change and the time feels right to let go.
