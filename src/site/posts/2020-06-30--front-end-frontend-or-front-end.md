As a frontend&nbsp;developer, something has always bothered me. How do you spell 'frontend'!? So at the weekend, I ran [my first Twitter Poll](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1276605361605263361?s=21), asking:

> So is it ‘front-end', ‘frontend’ or 'front end’?

I used to like the hyphen because:

- 'frontend' isn't an actual word
- 'front end' felt too separate

Hyphenating was a nice middle ground.

I remember a conversation over a couple of beers with my friends Sam and Colin when we were first discussing [starting a meet-up for frontend developers in the North East](https://sam.beckham.io/wrote/starting-a-meetup/). We were going to call it [Frontend NE](https://www.frontendne.co.uk), but should it be hyphenated? All one word? We all agreed it shouldn't have a space, so that was *something*.

We decided to go with one word because:

- it didn't *really* matter
- it would look a bit tidier when we came to design the logo

I had always used the hyphenated version for my own stuff and continued to do so. And that's where it started to wear me down… Remembering when to write 'front-end' and when to write 'frontend' was (slightly) onerous. Whenever I referred to Frontend NE in my own writing, I was mixing it up: 'front-end' when referring to frontend development, and 'Frontend' when using the proper noun for Frontend NE. And when I wrote for Frontend NE, I had to remember never to use the hyphen.

So a couple of weeks ago I finally decided to make a change, and you've probably seen spoilers all through this post! I'm now **all-in on 'frontend'** and have [changed all references on my website to that](https://github.com/tempertemper/tempertemper.net/pull/300).

Back to the Twitter Poll, [the results were in last night](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1277699216673050624?s=21):

- 'frontend' (all one word) wins with **59%** of the vote
- the hyphenated 'front-end' comes in second place with **33%**
- in last place, with only **8%** of the vote, the space-separated 'front end'

Not that I would have reverted the changes to my website, but I'm glad to see the majority agrees that 'frontend' is the correct spelling.
