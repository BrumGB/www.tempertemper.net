title: What if no-one's listening?
intro: |
    Spending hours writing and editing a blog post only to publish and get zero feedback can be demoralising. My advice? Keep going!

I jotted down my [thoughts down on sharing](/blog/share-anyway) a couple of months ago, but the online world can still be a daunting place. Especially as feedback is relatively rare.

I glanced past a tweet a couple of weeks ago (I wish I'd copied the URL!) that made me chuckle; it said something along the lines of:

> I get far more engagement on Twitter from posting about my cat than I do a carefully crafted blog post, and that's just the way I like it!

Whether it's just the way *I* like it is up for debate, but it's true that spending hours writing and editing a blog post only to watch a vaguely bird-shaped tumble weed blow past can feel deflating. My advice? Keep putting yourself out there.

Before having children, I was the singer and rhythm guitarist in a band. When a gig was going badly (wrong crowd, dodgy sound, having a general off-day) and the crowd were generally disinterested, I would look for one or two people who seemed to be getting something out of it and play for them.

Even if *nobody* is listening, think of it this way: they're not listening *yet*. One day, something you write will get someone's attention via a Google search, or a stray Retweet, and when they visit your website they'll have a healthy back-catalogue of interesting articles to read and share.

Keep writing. Keep vlogging. Keep doing your thing. If what you're doing gets through to *just one person*---teaches them something important or ignites a spark---what you're doing is worthwhile.
