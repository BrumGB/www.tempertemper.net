Language is important. I've noticed a movement towards renaming the `master` Git branch, as the term is [racially charged](https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-alternative-term-to-avoid-slavery-references/).

I shouldn't have been surprised to see some push-back from some quarters, but, even if I couldn't see the problem, there are *zero downsides*. Well, unless you count a minute's worth of configuration a downside!

My position of privilege as a white person might mean I'm unaware of some issues other groups face, but when they come up in conversation or I read something that hadn't occurred to me, I'm more than happy to take action.

GitHub are now using `main` as the default branch name, which I agree is a good alternative. Unlike `primary`, `root` and `default`, `main` starts with the same letters as `master`, so there's no need to retrain my <kbd>m</kbd>, <kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>â‡¥</kbd> (tab) muscle memory to autocomplete the branch name.

So I'm following suit and changing the name of the `master` branch in all of my Git repositories to `main`.

Anyway, let's keep talking and keep sharing: I believe in both learning something new every day, and continually making positive changes, big or small.
