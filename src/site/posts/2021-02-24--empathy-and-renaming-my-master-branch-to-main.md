title: Empathy, and renaming my 'master' branch to 'main'

    I've noticed a move towards renaming the `master` Git branch. It's a racially charged term and I'm very happy to switch from `master` to `main`.

Language is important. I've noticed a movement towards renaming the `master` Git branch as the term is [racially charged](https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-alternative-term-to-avoid-slavery-references/).

I shouldn't have been surprised to see some push-back from some quarters, but, even if I couldn't see the problem (I absolutely can), there are *zero downsides*. Well, unless you count a minute's worth of configuration a downside!

My position of privilege as a white person means I'm unaware of some issues people of colour face, but when I learn something I didn't know I'm always glad to make a positive change, big or small.

GitHub are now using `main` as the default branch name, which I agree is a good alternative to `master`. Unlike `primary`, `root` and `default`, `main` starts with the same letters as `master`, so there's no need to retrain my <kbd>m</kbd>, <kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>â‡¥</kbd> (tab) muscle memory to autocomplete the branch name. So I'm following suit and [changing the name of the `master` branch](/blog/how-to-rename-the-master-branch-on-github) in all of my Git repositories to `main`.

Most importantly, I'll keep talking, reading, listening and seeking to understand other points of view; learning and sharing as I go.
