title: It's good to make mistakes
intro: As a designer and developer I've made countless mistakes, but that's part of the reason I'm good at what I do.

Like all five year olds, my son did something the other day, and I had to correct him. Afterwards he said he felt embarrassed, so I reassured him that it was OK to have done it, and that we all have to learn somehow.

As a designer and developer, particularly looking back now through my lens as an accessibility specialist, I've made countless mistakes.

One thing in particular came to mind recently: I used to add a single hidden link in each email I sent out for [Frontend NE](https://www.frontendne.co.uk). I would put a link on:

- punctuation, like a full stop, comma, or exclamation mark
- a random letter in a word, usually a slim character like <kbd>i</kbd> or <kbd>l</kbd>
- an emoji

These were deliberately hard to spot; [Easter eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)) that, to make matters worse, usually linked to an animated GIF to add some humour. My intentions were good, but there were a bunch of problems in doing this:

- The link was always a very small target, putting some users who spotted it (those with a motor impairment, for example) at a disadvantage
- Accidentally following a hidden link would takes the reader away from their task at hand, meaning they've got to get back to their email app from the browser tab that has just opened
- The content doesn't tell the reader [what is at the end of the link](/blog/here-here-and-here)
- Links to [inaccessible content](/blog/accessible-animated-gifs-are-pointless)
- Provides no *real* value

That's just one example; I could give you more, but I think it illustrates my point. We don't know what we don't know, and sometimes we find out the right way to do things by getting things wrong---sometimes publicly and embarrassingly so---but the experience makes us better at what we do.

Keep doing, keep learning, and keep correcting. Mistakes are a big part of progress, and I hope to continue to make them.
