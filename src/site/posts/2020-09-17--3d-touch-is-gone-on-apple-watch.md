watchOS 7 has removed 3D Touch (Force Touch?) from Apple Watch. I noticed it almost immediately when I went to try out the new Faces that arrived with the updated OS; instead of pushing hard on the watch face, it's now a long press.

Initially, [I wondered if Apple might leave 3D Touch on the watch](/blog/looks-like-3d-touch-is-going-away) as it was so prevalent:

> The exception may be Apple Watch, where 3D Touch is more ubiquitous

But progress is progress, and with that, 3D Touch is no more. It still works on my iPhone XS, where it still makes sense as a shortcut, having been replaced like-for-like with a long press (Haptic Touch).

MacRumours have good round up of [how Apple have replace 3D Touch](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/watchos-7-force-touch-gone/); spoiler alert: they've replaced each long press thoughtfully, using long presses, icons or buttons where most appropriate.

A couple of years ago I managed to crack my watch's screen, which meant I had to replace the device. Since then---and I know Apple designed those screens to be pressed with force---I've been slightly nervous about pushing hard on the glass. The new ways to access the features 3D Touch used to activate are nicely thought through, so, all things told, I'm not sad Apple have removed it.
