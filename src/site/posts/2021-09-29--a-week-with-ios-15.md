I've been using iOS 15 for [just over a week](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1440008507693088768?s=21) and there are some changes that have made a big difference. Here's a quick rundown of the things that stood out the most:

- [Face ID bypass for sunglasses](/blog/ios-15-face-id-sunglasses-and-apple-watch) with an unlocked Apple Watch
- Weather:
    - Loads more detail in the redesigned Weather app! No more guessing what numbers mean, and lots more useful information, including map overlays
    - No more disorienting scroll-snap past the relatively small header area in Weather
    - Weather notifications, so I know when to bring the washing in from the line!
- Maps:
    - The redesign looks great; the higher contrast makes at-a-glance reference while driving easier
    - You can now zoom all the way out to view the earth as a globe, which is great for showing the kids how places on the map actually relate to one another
- Multiple photos in Messages appear in a fan, which is much easier to look at and flick through; [turns out carousels *can* be useful](https://shouldiuseacarousel.com)!
- Safari:
    - The address bar is now at the bottom of the screen, very much in range of my thumb
    - Swiping on the address bar to switch tabs is really handy
    - Swipe left from the right-most tab to open a new tab
    - Tab overview is now really useful
    - Extensions look great; I've been using [Noir](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/noir-dark-mode-for-safari/id1581140954), which forces a Dark Mode theme on websites that don't already have a Dark Mode variant

One thing I'm very excited about but haven't done too much with yet is the new Password management and built-in two factor authentication. [I want to ditch 1Password](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1443091157681123331?s=21), and this could be a good bare-bones replacement; I just need to wait until Monterey is released so I can get a feel for how it all works cross-device.
