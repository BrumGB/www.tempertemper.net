I spent over five years happily tinkering with my brand, trying to find a way to tie in a stand-alone icon that I was happy. Now five years is a long time, but this story starts before that, with my original brand.

My original branding was ok… I used the friendly-looking [Museo Sans](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo-sans/) as my main typeface and my logo used [OCR-A](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/ocra/), a retro monospace font, set white on a smokey blue background with the words 'temper' and 'temper' stacked on top of one another.

It served me well for the first few years, but it was always something I was looking to overhaul. I set five rules for a re-brand:

1. I had always _written_ 'tempertemper' as one word, so the logo should follow this -- no separation
2. The logo should include some kind of icon or motif that I could use separately
3. It should work well against a white background, which my original logo never really did
4. It should convert well to work against a dark/black background, which my original logo definitely never did
5. Without losing friendliness, the typefaces should feel more classic; less cartoony

My re-brand work started with the logo, with the notion that the typeface and general colour palette would stem from there.


## A first stab

I've always been a fan of [Helvetica Neue](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/) in a bold weight, so a lot of early concepts involved that.

    <source srcset="/assets/img/blog/tempertemper-logo--v2.0-alpha.webp" type="image/webp" />
    <img src="/assets/img/blog/tempertemper-logo--v2.0-alpha.png" alt="The first half-decent attempt at a redesign of the tempertemper logo -- Helvetica Neue in smokey-blue against a white background" width="800" height="450" loading="lazy"  decoding="async" />
</picture>

It was progress, but it only fully satisfied the first rule:

1. It was presented as one word
2. There was no motif/icon
3. As the bold letterforms were more distinct, it worked better than the original logo against a white background, but it wasn't great; changing it to black was better but it lost character
4. Similarly, it worked *ok* on a black background; again, it was better in white, but felt a bit lifeless
5. Although beautiful, Helvetica Neue can feel a bit aloof -- classy but far from approachable

Furthermore, the way the `r` of the first `temper` met the `t` of the second (the ear of the `r` is thicker than the crossbar of the `t`) didn't sit right with me; this was especially true of black text on a white background. Also, Helvetica Neue's lowercase `a` and uppercase `R` are *incredibly* elegant, so a logo without them felt like a missed opportunity!


## Bringing in the big guns

So in the summer of 2014 I called in my good friend [Ant Barker](https://designbyant.co.uk), who I've collaborated with on countless client projects. He built upon the work I'd been doing and came up with something we were both very happy with!

    <img src="/assets/img/blog/tempertemper-logo--v2.0.png" alt="The redesigned tempertemper logo, set in FS-Me in black with a bright blue underscore immediately after the second r, against a white background" width="800" height="450" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
</picture>

1. It was presented as one word
2. An underscore, which represents a cursor, tying it into both coding and writing
3. The black text works well against a white background and the (newly brightened) blue in the underscore provided a touch of vibrancy/fun
4. It was easily switched to white text to accommodate a dark background
4. The typeface (FS-Me) draws inspiration from Helvetica, so feels classic, but has a much more approachable feel:
    - There are no sharp edges to the letterforms
    - The softened corners on that previously-troublesome first `r` and second `t` mean they flow into one another well, despite having different thicknesses
    - The upward curves of the terminals on the `t` give it a wee bit of extra energy
    - The `e`s are especially friendly-looking
    What's more, [FS-Me was designed with accessibility in mind](/blog/tempertempers-typefaces) which very much appeals to me


## An iteration

In the five and a half years since that branding work my business has changed a lot! And the branding was flexible enough to allow for that, but one thing has been bugging me all those years: there wasn't a true icon.

The square canvas version of the logo used the two `t`s and the underscore, which looked smart enough, but:

- Letter-based icons feel too easy! I wanted a single shape/mark
- It wasn't all that distinguishable at very small sizes
- It drew attention to the `t`s as initial letters of two separate words; something I'd be looking to avoid
- Some people [think of cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_TT) when they see two `t`s


### Working on a new icon

The iteration of my logo started with the idea that I needed a more illustrative, stand-alone icon.

I started with blue fire icon, which was a (tenuous) [reference to tempering steel](/blog/why-tempertemper), where metal is heated up then rapidly cooled down in order to increase its durability and efficiency. The fire icon went through revision after revision as I *wanted* to like it, but it wasn't right.

The more icons I tried---a rocket ship (too start-upy), a star (too audacious), a lightening bolt (too flashy), a broadcast symbol (too RSS)---the more I felt simpler was the way to go.

I spent hours looking through the [thousands of Unicode characters](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/category/So) for some kind of punctuation. An asterisk looked nice but could suggest there might be some small print -- not questions I wanted to raise in people's minds. Curly braces (`{}`) had the right tone but have been done to death. Square brackets? A caret (`^`)? A triangle? Square? Circle? An arrow? Nah.

One day, on the bus home from work, I scrolled to a blog post by [Amy Hupe](https://amyhupe.co.uk) in my Twitter timeline that used a great big square full-stop as its icon, and it hit me: *the underscore was right all along*! All it needed was some tweaking and it could be used as a stand-alone icon in its own right.


## An iteration

Here's where I landed with the new design:

    <source srcset="/assets/img/blog/tempertemper-logo--v2.1.webp" type="image/webp" />
    <img src="/assets/img/blog/tempertemper-logo--v2.1.png" alt="The most recent iteration on the tempertemper logo in black with a thickened, non-rounded rectangle underscore, on a white background" width="800" height="450" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
</picture>

Don't see much difference? Well, there's not! But if you look closely:

- The underscore is <b>thicker</b>, to match the widths of ascenders (vertical lines) in the letters of the logotype, making it more prominent at smaller sizes
- It now has <b>square corners</b>, making it a perfect rectangle and well and truly checking the 'simplicity' box
- I gave it a <b>simple 4 × 1 aspect ratio</b>, which felt like the right proportions; it also fits nicely into an 8x8 square canvas

Here's a closer look at the new underscore, in comparison with its older shape:

<img src="/assets/img/blog/tempertemper-logo--v2.1--underscore.gif" alt="The old tempertemper logo animating into the new logo, to demonstrate the difference in the underscore" width="800" height="450" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />

### How's that icon looking?

So the change to the logo is pretty low-key. The biggest change is how that translates to an icon. So instead of the `tt_` icon, you'll be seeing something else:

<picture>
    <source srcset="/assets/img/blog/tempertemper-logo--v2.1--icon.avif" type="image/avif" />
    <source srcset="/assets/img/blog/tempertemper-logo--v2.1--icon.webp" type="image/webp" />
    <img src="/assets/img/blog/tempertemper-logo--v2.1--icon.png" alt="The new tempertemper icon in black on white, showing the 8 by 8 grid it was designed on; then coloured examples, first a blue square with a black underscore and a white square with a blue underscore on a black background, then a blue square with a white underscore and a black square with a blue underscore on a white background" width="800" height="450" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
</picture>

So it's a simple and very flexible icon; what's more:

- It's a single shape/mark
- It looks great at very small sizes
- It doesn't suggest tempertemper is two words
- It doesn't help Audi's marketing department


## The verdict

As I had been doing with all of my ideas, I ran it past Ant for a more objective out point of view:

> Its a subtle improvement to something that I always thought looked great. So it’s a yes from me!

So it turned out, as with most things design, the simplest solution was the best.
