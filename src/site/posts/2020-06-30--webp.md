title: Using WebP images
intro: |
    When using Git, you'll normally push work to an identically named branch on your remote, but what if you want to push to a different branch?

In last week's [roundup of the most interesting features announced at WWDC 2020](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wwdc-2020-roundup) I mentioned that Safari would now be supporting image aspect ratios.

Something else I noticed on their [Safari 14 release notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes/safari-14-beta-release-notes#Media) was that WebP would now be supported.

I was catching up on my reading at the weekend and read a short [CSS-Tricks article about WebP support in iOS 14](https://css-tricks.com/webp-image-support-coming-to-ios-14/) and I sprung into action!

In the article, Geoff Graham mentions:

> WebP is a super progressive format that encodes images in lossless and lossy formats that we get with other image formats we already use, like JPEG, but at a fraction of the file size

It has been around for a long time (Chrome was first, with partial support in 2011 and full support in 2014) but, now that Apple are on board, that's all the major browsers on board.

I've converted the image on my [About page](/about) to WebP and got an image file size of ~15k smaller than the .jpg equivalent, which is nice.

The main difference I've noticed is that gradients of colour (like the corona of light shining on a solid colour wall) are much smoother â€“ fewer artifacts. But there's a slight loss in detail.

And I've taken Geoff Graham's advice and added it as an enhancement with `<picture>`, rather than the default. I don't want any users of older Safari seeing the Alt text.

Same image compressed to same file size with both jpg and WebP, I'd expect the WebP to look better

WebP
