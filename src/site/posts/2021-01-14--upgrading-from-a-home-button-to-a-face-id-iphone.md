Going through some older draft blog posts, I found a list I wrote in late 2018 about upgrading from an iPhone 6 to an iPhone XS. The only Home button style iPhone Apple now sell is the SE, so the chances are you'll have moved to the new Home button-less form factor already, but for posterity, here were my thoughts:

- The XS feels much sturdier; the extra thickness and weight makes it feel [less likely to bend](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/23/iphone-6-plus-bending-pockets/), or be blown out of my hand by a gust of wind
- It's *fast*! iOS 11.3 made my iPhone 6 nice and fast again, but there was often still a noticeable lag; with the XS everything is immediate
- I use Control Centre a lot less as I hold the phone in my left hand, so I have to use my right hand to swipe down from the top-right of the screen, which is a chore
- In truth I generally only used Control Centre for the torch, which is easily accessible via the Lock Screen on the XS
- The sound is *great*! I can listen to a podcast while doing the washing up without having to get my AirPods out
- The OLED display is amazing. Perfect blacks and more and more of my favourite apps rolling out 'true black' themes
- I don't care about the lack of headphone jack as I use AirPods or Beats Solo3
- The official Apple leather case is much nicer than the equivalent for the iPhone 6: the volume and power buttons are *actually buttons*
- Haptic feedback is *really* nice
- App shortcuts from the home screen via 3D Touch are really convenient (choose a book in Books, scan a document in Notes, compose a new tweet in Tweetbot)
- Some interactions are weird, for example Quick Responses (the like/love/dislike/laugh/exclamation/question replies) in iMessage feels like something 3D Touch should activate, but it's a long press instead. Trips me up every time
- Raise to wake and tap to wake are really intuitive
- Notification details on lock screen only showing when Face ID is successful is a great feature
- I quickly got used to swiping up to close apps
- I don't notice the notch
- The edge-to-edge form factor allows apps' headers and bottom navigation to become the new 'forehead' and 'chin'
- The app switcher bar is really convenient compared to double clicking the Home button
- Reachability is now precariously low down on the handset; not for one-handed use

Only a couple of downsides (Control Centre access and Reachability), both of which have been alleviated by the addition of the [Back Tap accessibility shortcut](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/ios-14s-back-tap-a-better-way-to-access-control-centre) in iOS 14.

One more I'd add from my position here in January 2021 is very much a transitory (I hopeâ€¦) issue: Face ID doesn't work when wearing a mask. The new iPad Air has a Touch ID sensor built into the top button, which would be a fantastic addition to the iPhone (though cases would have to be cleverly designed). It would also make unlocking the phone [when wearing Sunglasses](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/face-id-and-sunglasses) easier. Although human beings can recognise one another when wearing a mask or sunglasses, so maybe Face ID just needs to get smarter?
