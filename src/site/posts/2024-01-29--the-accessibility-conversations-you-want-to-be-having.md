intro: In most companies, accessibility conversations centre around WCAG compliance, but that's just the start. Thinking beyond that is where you want to be!

For a lot of companies, accessibility conversations centre around achieving a certain level of accessibility; usually thatâ€™s something to do with WCAG (the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) to a [particular version](/blog/wcag-2-2-in-language-i-can-understand) and [conformance level](/blog/bag-some-aaa-wins-where-you-can).

Where I work there are lots and lots (and lots!) of digital products. All are working hard to achieve a level of accessibility, but the vast majority are not at that baseline WCAG 2.1 AA level of compliance yet.

Last week I was heartened when two separate conversations about two separate products were around the *experience* of screen reader users, rather than if a screen reader user would actually be able to use the product.

*These* are the types of accessibility conversations you want to be having!
