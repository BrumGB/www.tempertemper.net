I love those old-school ASCII art drawings. They're full of character and pre-emoji charm. Remember using a colon and a closing bracket for a smiley face? Or my personal favourite, the shrug:

```
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```

Visually, it has a lot going for it, but to a screen reader users (apologies if you've just listened to that via a screen reader!) it's gibberish:

> Space with a combining macron backslash underscore comma underscore slash space with

<i>I should mention that I've never actually typed all of those brackets, slashes and underscores; I [map a shortcut like `sshrug` to a text snippet](/blog/text-snippets-on-apple-devices).</i>


## What I'm doing instead

Instead of burdening non-sighted people with all of those ASCII characters, I'm sticking to emojis:

```
🤷‍♂️
```

That one conveys the same visual meaning as the ASCII shrugger but is much more understandable for screen reader users:

> Man shrugging
