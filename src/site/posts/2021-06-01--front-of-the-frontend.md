Frontend development use to be simple. First it was just HTML, then it was HTML, CSS and some JavaScript; then it exploded.

In its the early days, JavaScript (usually via jQuery) was used for things like link roll-over styling and animation, but CSS rightly stepped up and took these responsibilities, it being the de facto language for styling the web. JavaScript became about actions triggered by a button press, changing the order of items with drag and drop, that kind of thing.

This is JavaScript doing stuff in the browser; frontend development. But the line between frontend and backend (server-side stuff) started to blur when we started to fetched data dynamically from a server for things like live sports feeds. That's JavaScript running in the browser but interacting with a server on the fly.

Then the frontend world dove head-first into [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) and single page apps, using JavaScript frameworks like [backbone.js](https://backbonejs.org), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org), and [React](https://reactjs.org). At this stage I completely lost interest. But this is where backend developers started to move to the frontend, and more logical-minded frontend developers found their comfort zone.

Me? I continued writing HTML and CSS, and got interested in static site generators and templating languages like [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/). I still considered myself a frontend developer, but describing what I did required some extra explanation:

- "I'm a frontend developer, but I don't know any JavaScript frameworks"
- "I'm a frontend developer, but I'm an HTML and CSS specialist"
- "I'm a frontend developer, but I'm not really a *programmer*"

My frontend identity crisis is very similar to how I remember explaining the type of designer I am to people before terms like 'user experience design' and 'interaction design' became industry-recognised:

- "I'm a designer, but I'm not really all that creative"
- "I'm a designer, but I focus on how things work, not how pretty they look"

So my ears pricked up when I began to read articles like [The Great Divide](https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/), see job titles like [Design Engineer](https://adactio.com/journal/17838), hear terms like '[Front of the frontend](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/)', and see tweets about [Design Ops](https://twitter.com/codepo8/status/1349055788699054081?s=20).

I'm glad I kept resolute on my path and wasn't tempted to shift my career towards the back of the frontend:

- CSS is getting more and more powerful, interesting, and can have a profound effect on the user
- HTML is always going to be the output, regardless of any framework, and caring about it helps ensure a good, usable experience for *everyone*

[The web is just over 25 years old](https://www.w3.org/webat25/), and if I look back at my life so far, that was the age I began to really settle into myself. I feel like after all these years of rapid change and evolution, with more specific definitions of roles like design engineer, the web is starting to come of age.
