The closing comments of [a recent CSS-Tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/embrace-the-unpredictable/) are great:

> Just remember: apply carefully, and always be mindful of accessibility/UX. Magically evolving designs are great, but only if they are great for everyone.

Design is a hugely responsible role, and one of those responsibilities is ensuring *everyone* can use our websites, products, services, and applications.

We have to think about the content; for example, should we:

- Use video if we can't afford the time to add subtitles or a transcription?
- Use abbreviations and symbols without explaining them first?
- Link to other places when it isn't clear where the user will land?

Then there's how users interact with our site:

- Are we using [colour alone to convey meaning](/blog/why-you-should-almost-always-underline-your-links)?
- Have we thought about visible keyboard focus states for interactive elements like links, buttons, and form fields?
- Does [content change unexpectedly when a form field is filled in a certain way](/blog/if-html-and-aria-dont-allow-it-its-probably-a-bad-idea)?

And that's just the tip of the iceberg…

I'm reminded of [a line from, of all places, Jurassic Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRNX6XJOeGU):

> Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.
