Since my post on [refining my brand](/blog/the-simplest-solutions-are-usually-the-best), I've encountered a tiny issue that I wasn't able to ignore.

With a circular crop, which is what services like Twitter do, the 8 × 8 grid the icon uses leaves the rectangular underscore too close to the edge of the circle. I mean, it looks fine, but it *could be better*.

The position on the x-axis is fine; it's the height. It just needs lifting slightly. Lifting it a row on the 8 × 8 grid is too much -- that brings the top of the rectangle onto the centre, which is too high. Half of that amount works really well, which is where a 16 × 16 grid comes in.

It's worth mentioning that the 16 × 16 grid doesn't quite work on a square or rounded square canvas, so I won't be switching to the new grid completely. The 8 × 8 grid is perfect for those uses -- super simple and nicely positioned/proportioned.

But where I know a service will display my icon on a circular canvas, I'll be using that 16 × 16 grid in order to raise the underscore up a tiny amount. It's a shame there isn't a one-size-fits-all, but if a service that currently uses a square avatar switches to a round one (or vice versa), it's not the end of the world -- the icon still looks fine; just not *perfect*.

I can feel my team-mates' eyes rolling whenever I pick out minutia like this on the Government services I work on, but I'll happily continue to do so -- attention to detail can have a big impact on the confidence users have in the products we ship.
