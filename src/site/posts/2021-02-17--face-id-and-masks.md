title: Face ID and masks
intro: |
    Face ID is great, but now that we're all wearing masks in public our passcodes are seeing a lot more use. Luckily, Apple have a solution in the pipeline.

I've had a Face ID iPhone for a couple of years now; I love it, and couldn't imagine going back to a Touch ID finger print sensor on my phone again. I never have to think about unlocking my phone or authorising a banking app; it *just works*.

Well, mostly… I've written about [the problem sunglasses present](/blog/face-id-and-sunglasses), but the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a new (and very necessary!) barrier to Face ID: masks.

Paying for stuff hasn't been much of an issue as I have an Apple Watch, but if I want to check my shopping list or text my wife when I'm browsing the supermarket aisles, I have to [type my passcode](/blog/custom-numeric-passcodes-on-iphone) or surreptitiously lower my mask to get past my lock screen.

When the new iPad Air with [Touch ID integrated in the lock button](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/10/04/power-button-touch-id-on-the-ipad-air-4-was-an-incredible-feat) was announced, I thought Apple might integrate a fall-back Touch ID sensor in the same place in the iPhones 12, but I guess:

- hardware design and manufacturing lead-time is *much* longer than the 9 or 10 months between the onset of the pandemic and the new phones being released
- it's almost certainly an expensive thing to add, and the amount of use it would get would make an increased handset cost (or reduced profit margins!) a difficult sell
- some compromises (battery life?) would have to be made to physically accommodate the extra hardware for the sensor
- phone cases would probably cover the sensor, or make the now-indented exposed button less easy to press

Anyway, Apple have something much smarter in the pipeline, in the form of a [software feature in iOS 14.5](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/ios-14-5-unlock-iphone-with-apple-watch/):

> there's a new option to unlock an iPhone with Face ID and an Apple Watch paired together … If you're wearing an unlocked Apple Watch and use Face ID as you normally would, the iPhone will unlock after a partial face scan.

I know it relies on an Apple Watch, which might not be within many people's financial reach, but:

- for those that do have an Apple Watch, it's going to be very helpful
- it provides another reason to buy an Apple Watch for those that don't have one

I very much doubt the partial scan will extend to mask *and* sunglasses, but I wonder if it will work when the nose and mouth are exposed, but not the eyes, putting an end to the sunglasses issue?
