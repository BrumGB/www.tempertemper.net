title: Blog posts by year
intro: |
    I've written a lot over the years! Head to a year to find the blog posts I wrote then:
layout: default
permalink: /blog/years.html
---

<p>
    {%- set years = collections.post | getYears %}
    {%- for year in years | reverse %}
        <a href="/blog/year/{{ year }}">{{ year }}</a>{%- if not loop.last -%}, {%- else -%}.{% endif %}
    {%- endfor %}
</p>
