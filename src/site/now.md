title: The things I'm up to right now
intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- Basking in the glory of a finished kitchen, after 4 or 5 long weeks of workmen, takeaways, defrosting batch-cooked meals, and washing up in a big tub in the bath
- Happy to have my 'office' back, now that my 9 year old daughter is back at school
- Hoping, as I'm in my early 40s, that I'm not too far down the COVID-19 vaccination list
- Very sad after losing our 15 year old cat Rudi to illness resulting from feline diabetes
- A wee bit uncomfortable after some minor surgery that (hopefully!) means we won't be having any more children
- Still really enjoying The Wire, and half way through the fourth season
