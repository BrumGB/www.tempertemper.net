- Coping with lockdown; I'm working from our bedroom while my wife home-schools the kids
- Nearly finished the bathroom renovations â€“ just need normal life to resume so we can get the joiner in to apply the finishes!
- Enjoying playing [Super Mario World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World) with my 8 year old daughter on [our SNES Mini](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1194334500899045377?s=21)
- Starting to record the first few videos for my mini-series on HTML fundamentals for [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/tempertemper)
- Waking up at 5am to snatch an hour and a half of writing before the kids surface
