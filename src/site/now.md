intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- Settling into a healthy routine of
    - [a daily cold shower](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000v83f)
    - a 5 kilometre run every day
    - morning press-ups (currently at 40)
    - no alcohol
    - no rubbish (chocolate, cakes, biscuits)
- Sad to have had to abandon our break in Barcelona: with the COVID-19 numbers being so high, there would have been too much self-isolating before travelling there/back, and the potential of [moving from Amber to Red](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england) or flights being cancelled would have been stressful
- Relieved that my wife and I have had our second COVID-19 vaccinations (both Astra Zenica)
- After a last-day-of-term COVID-19 scare from our youngest, glad that the kids are out of the school/nursery Petri dish
- Continuing to wear a mask at indoor public places, despite what Â¾ of the population seem to be doing
- Avoiding indoor public places wherever possible, until the numbers come right down
- Taking a fortnight off work; the first time I've had more than a few days off without a kitchen being renovated since August last year
- Looking forward to a trip to Edinburgh Zoo with the kids during my break, and visiting some family up in Scotland
