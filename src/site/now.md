title: The things I'm up to right now
intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- After a bit of a rainy blip (maybe 3 weeks is more than a blipâ€¦) in May, really enjoying the sunny weather again; I'm trying to make a point of working from the garden when I can
- Glad to have seen my parents in person for the first time in many months
- Getting impatient to fly to Barcelona to visit my wife's family once travelling gets easier; it has been a year and a half since we last saw them all
- Happy that my wife and I have had our first COVID-19 vaccinations (both Astra Zenica) with minimal side effects; next jabs in July!
- Exhausted but satisfied, now that I've finished all the outstanding paint jobs that were weighing on me following all of the work we've had done in the house (new cupboard under the stairs, kitchen skirting boards, boxing for pipes in the kitchen, and so on)
