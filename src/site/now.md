intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- Worried about the current situation in Ukraine
- Finally getting over a filthy cold that has lasted two weeks; would've sworn it was COVID-19 but for continually testing negative
- Missing my [cold showers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000v83f) and daily run â€“ can't wait to feel better
- Still enjoying [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)
- Gearing up to tackle the renovation of our yard: paving, and repointing the sandstone walls
- Continuing to [stand up at work](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1436331696408911898?s=21); can't see myself going back to a sitting desk set up now!
- Concerned that COVID-19 restrictions being completely lifted in the UK has happened too soon
- Getting into scales and music theory on [my bass guitar](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1449290497822965763) (having played rhythm guitar for over two decades, I never saw that coming!)
