- Still enjoying a daily routine of:
    - morning [press-ups](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000vp09)
    - [a cold shower](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000v83f)
    - a 5 kilometre run
- Managing to keep clear of sugary treats like chocolate, cakes, biscuits
- Avoiding alcohol; even though my consumption was modest (around [10 units per week](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/alcohol-support/calculating-alcohol-units/)) and limited to the weekend, stopping has meant better sleep and not waking up with a slightly heavy head
- Happy to be twice-vaccinated (Astra Zenica) but staying cautious: continuing to wear a mask indoors and avoiding crowds
- Trying out a [standing desk](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1436331696408911898?s=21) with a converter that sits on top of my normal desk
- Having played the guitar for over two decades, recently I've had a call to teach myself to [play the bass](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1449290497822965763)
