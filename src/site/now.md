title: The things I'm up to right now
intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- Well over Covid now, but I still feel that lingering grottiness and slightly sore throat when I've had a bad night's sleep; annoying that it's not quite shifting, even though my initial symptoms were relatively mild
- Running again (I can't tell you how much I've missed this, after a few months with Covid)
- Back from our first trip abroad in 2½ years! Port de Pollença in Mallorca is as beautiful place!
- After taxis, trains, planes, and airport lounges, I'm accustomed to being in public places, and mainly without a mask; not sure that's a good thing
- Still going with the [daily cold showers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000v83f)
- Continuing to [stand, rather than sit, to work](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1436331696408911898?s=21)
- Really digging into my guitar and bass after so many years of having no time to spare
- On the home stretch with the house renovations, having just had a beyond-repair part of the 120 year old roof replaced; just the garden path to go!
