intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- Having avoided it for two years, COVID-19 finally caught up with me after a trip to the office! It felt like a mild-ish flu, which was unpleasant but far from the more serious symptoms some others have experienced
- Back to the [daily cold showers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000v83f), now that Covid is out of my system
- Looking forward to going out for a run after several weeks of recuperation; just need to shift this lingering COVID-19-induced cough
- Very happy with the [new paving in our yard](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1512728020141977601)
- Continuing to [stand up at work](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1436331696408911898?s=21); can't see myself going back to a sitting desk set up now!
- Getting into scales and music theory on [my bass guitar](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1449290497822965763) (having played rhythm guitar for over two decades, I never saw that coming!)
