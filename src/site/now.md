title: The things I'm up to right now
intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- After a tumultuous 2020, really settling into my new role as Principal Experience Designer at Sage
- Sharing my 'office' with my 9 year old daughter now that the school has been closed again
- Preparing myself for my 4 year old son inevitably bursting into the room during serious meetings, now that the nursery has been closed
- Finishing the organisation of a new kitchen, due for installation in February; which hopefully won't be prevented by a full lockdown
