intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- After catching Covid in late March (with relatively mild symptoms), the lingering grottiness and slightly sore throat have *finally* shifted after more than six months
- In a good rhythm with running when working from home, and [cycling to the office](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1546555003560771585) once a week or so
- Still going with the [daily cold showers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000v83f)
- Continuing to [stand, rather than sit, to work](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1436331696408911898?s=21)
- Really digging into my guitar and bass after so many years of having no time to spare for anything other than work and childcare
- Enjoying following the football again; all this extra time as the kids get more independent is great!
- On the home stretch of home improvements: after a bit of a false start, the loft conversion is due to be finished over the course of the next few weeks
