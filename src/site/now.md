title: The things I'm up to right now
intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- Following the Christmas weekend of laziness and overindulgence, I'm:
    - getting back to avoiding sugary treats (my mum's chocolate cheesecake was too good to resist…)
    - abstaining from alcohol again; after a few days of even a pretty modest [12-ish units per day](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/alcohol-support/calculating-alcohol-units/), I'm sleeping better and feeling less sluggish in the mornings
    - restarting my daily 5 kilometre run (even after only a few days off it has felt harder than normal; both the run itself and motivating myself to do it)
- Still taking [a cold shower every morning](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000v83f), although with winter's arrival the water is too cold to stand still in without giving me brain freeze…
- Keeping up the morning [press-ups](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000vp09)
- Happy to have gotten my COVID-19 booster but still steering clear of busy places and socialising indoors; probably mostly out of habit, as I normally only leave the house to exercise
- Starting to prefer [my standing desk](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1436331696408911898?s=21) to sitting
- Having played (rhythm) guitar for over two decades, [I bought myself a bass](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1449290497822965763) and am getting very into *theory*, which I thought would never happen!
