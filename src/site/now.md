- After having been made redundant, looking forward to starting my new job at the end of September
- Enjoying a five weeks break between jobs
- Looking forward to the kids going back to school after 5 months of lockdown
- Not looking forward to the kids going back to school after 5 months of lockdown â€“ it'll be quiet without them, and there's the greatly increased risk of exposure to COVID-19
- Starting to record the first few videos for my mini-series on HTML fundamentals for [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/tempertemper)
