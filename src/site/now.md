title: The things I'm up to right now
intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- Well over Covid now, but I still feel that lingering grottiness and slightly sore throat when I've had a bad night's sleep; annoying that it's not quite shifting after all this time, even though my initial symptoms were relatively mild
- Running again (I can't tell you how much I've missed this, after a few months with Covid)
- Cycling! [I bought a bike](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1546555003560771585) through my company's Cycle to Work scheme and I've been enjoying the odd evening ride in the local countryside, running errands, and will be heading to the office on it next week
- Back from our first trip abroad in 2½ years! Port de Pollença in Mallorca is as beautiful place!
- After taxis, trains, planes, and airport lounges, I'm getting more accustomed to being in public places, mostly without a mask; strange times
- Still going with the [daily cold showers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000v83f)
- Continuing to [stand, rather than sit, to work](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1436331696408911898?s=21)
- Really digging into my guitar and bass after so many years of having no time to spare for
- I thought the home renovations were nearly over, we're finalising plans for our loft to be converted to hobby room!
