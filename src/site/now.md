title: The things I'm up to right now
intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- Like most of the planet, enjoying [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)
- Making the most of the unseasonably reasonable weather we're having and meeting up with family and old friends I haven't seen for a while for outdoor walks with the kids
- Gearing up to tackle the renovation of our yard: paving, and repointing the sandstone walls
- Trying to steer clear of politics on Twitter, which is proving no easy feat at the moment, but all those keyword mute filters in Tweetbot are bringing my frustration levels down somewhat
- After a couple of months, I still haven't sat down to work: [the standing desk](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1436331696408911898?s=21) is going strong!
- Happy to have gotten my COVID-19 booster but still steering clear of busy places and socialising indoors; probably mostly out of habit, as I normally only leave the house to exercise
- Having played (rhythm) guitar for over two decades, [I bought myself a bass](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1449290497822965763) and am getting very into *theory*, which I thought would never happen!
- Still taking [a cold shower every morning](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000v83f)
- Keeping up the morning [press-ups](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000vp09) and going for a daily 5 kilometre run
