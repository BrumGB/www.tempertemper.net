title: The things I'm up to right now
intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- Only just over Covid. It was relatively mild, no doubt due to vaccination, but it lingered, taking 6 weeks for me to feel 100% again; even then I still have a lingering sore throat
- Continuing to keep a low profile, as I've heard many accounts of people coming down with Covid again within a month or two -- this pandemic is not overâ€¦
- Back to the [daily cold showers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000v83f)
- Running again (I can't tell you how much I've missed this)
- After [standing for to work](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1436331696408911898?s=21) for around 6 months, I'm all-in, and have got rid of my office chair!
- Took my guitar and amp to a friends house and had my first jam in 14 years!
- Very happy with the [new paving in our yard](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1512728020141977601); now for the guttering and outside pipe work
