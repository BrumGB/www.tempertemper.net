title: The things I'm up to right now
intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- Enjoying the challenge of a 16 kilometre (each way) [cycle to the office](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1546555003560771585) twice a week
- When not at the office, getting up and going for a run every morning at 5/5:30am
- Continuing to [stand, rather than sit, for work](https://mastodon.social/@tempertemper/110281662026715175), and absolutely smitten with my new [Apple Studio Display](https://www.apple.com/uk/studio-display/)
- Nearly three years into the [daily cold showers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000v83f)
- Enjoying watching my football team when I can (I've been to one match so far this season)
- Still enjoying Pokémon Go (I'm currently level 42), even though the kids' interest has waned slightly…
- Just over a nasty bout of scarlet fever. Not fun!
