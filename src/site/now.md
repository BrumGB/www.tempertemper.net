intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- Still enjoying a daily routine of:
    - a 5 kilometre run
    - [a cold shower](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000v83f)
    - morning [press-ups](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000vp09) (currently at 60)
- Managing to keep clear of sugary treats like chocolate, cakes, biscuits
- Avoiding alcohol; even though my consumption was modest (around [10 units per week](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/alcohol-support/calculating-alcohol-units/)) and limited to the weekend, stopping has meant better sleep and not waking up with a slightly heavy head
- Happy to be twice-vaccinated (Astra Zenica) but staying cautious: continuing to wear a mask, going easy on public indoor spaces, and avoiding crowds
- Wondering what's going to happen with COVID-19 rates now that the schools are back and most precautions have been lifted
- Trying out a [standing desk](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1436331696408911898?s=21) with a converter that sits on top of my normal desk
- Getting back into the guitar after a long hiatus, now that the kids are getting a bit older and I'm finding myself with a bit more free time
- Teaching my daughter how to play the guitar!
