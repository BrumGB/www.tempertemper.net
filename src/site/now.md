title: The things I'm up to right now
intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- In a good rhythm with running when working from home, and [cycling to the office](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1546555003560771585) once every couple of weeks or so
- Continuing to [stand, rather than sit, for work](https://mastodon.social/@tempertemper/110281662026715175), and absolutely smitten with my new [Apple Studio Display](https://www.apple.com/uk/studio-display/)
- Two years into the [daily cold showers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000v83f)
- Getting up and going for a run every morning at 5/5:30am; took a while to psyche myself up for it but I'm in a good rhythm now and it sets me up for the day nicely
- Really digging into my guitar and bass after so many years of having no time to spare for anything other than work and childcare
- Enjoying following the football again, and even getting tickets to the odd match through some excellent season ticket holding friends; even taking my daughter to her first match on Sunday!
- All done with the (indoor) home improvements; just the odd bit of painting and picture to put up here and there
- Getting ready to repoint the stone walls in the back yard and tackle the woodwork on the front bay window
- Enjoying the better weather after what felt like a long winter; the longer days and consistently-above-freezing temperatures are very welcome
- Hooked on Pokémon Go again! My youngest got into Pokémon and asked for the app for a Christmas present so I resurrected my old account, got him and his elder sister accounts and we've been catching Pokémon for a good few months now
