- Enjoying playing [The Legend of Zelda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past) with my daughter on [the most exciting Christmas present](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1194334500899045377?s=21) I've bought myself in years
- Gearing up to begin bathroom renovations
- Enjoying a more relaxed home-life now that my youngest is in nursery full time and my [my wife](https://twitter.com/energybubble) has started work again
- Waking up at 5am to snatch an hour and a half of writing before the kids surface
- Making a concerted effort to get a mini-series on HTML fundamentals recorded for [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/tempertemper)
- Continuing my [Adventures in Git&trade;](/category/git) (last summer I ditched my GUI and went all-in on the command line)
- Working out how to consolidate all the JavaScript I (*finally*) learned last year
- Exploring [serverless](https://www.netlify.com) and [the JAMStack](https://jamstack.org)
