- Looking forward to a nostalgic Christmas with [the most exciting present](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1194334500899045377?s=21) I've bought myself in years
- Taking a break from home improvements, after a hard couple of months' work renovating the bedrooms
- Taking more time with [my wife](https://twitter.com/energybubble), now that our youngest is finally (after 2Â½ years) sleeping through the night and can stay overnight with my parents
- Carrying on waking up at 5am to snatch an hour of writing before the kids surface
- Continuing my [Adventures in Git&trade;](/category/git) (in summer I ditched my GUI and went all-in on the command line)
- Making a concerted effort to learn JavaScript properly after nearly a decade of tentative tinkering
- Exploring serverless and [the JAMStack](https://jamstack.org)
