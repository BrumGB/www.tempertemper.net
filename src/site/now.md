title: The things I'm up to right now
intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- Working hard on a presentation for [the Technically podcast](https://technica11y.org) on the 5th of May, where I take a deep dive into the `<section>` element
- Enjoying the sunny weather, even if there has been the odd wet spell; the kids being able to go out and play in the garden makes life so much easier
- Happy with the slightly more relaxed lockdown rules; even if, working from home and the father of two young children, I don't really benefit much from them, it's good to know the hospitalisations and deaths are coming right down
- My wife has had her first COVID-19 vaccination and I'm next: just need to find a free slot at a local vaccination centre on a date that works
- Still enjoying this new kitchen: the half-size diswasher is *perfect* and, having taken a bit of a leap of faith with the induction hob, I'd happily never use a gas hob again!
- Having finished The Wire (that last season was a bit far-fetched but somehow managed not to ruin the story as a whole), we've discovered Fargo. Almost finished season 2 and it's *amazing*
